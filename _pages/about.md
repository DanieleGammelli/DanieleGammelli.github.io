I'm a PhD student in Machine Learning and Mathematical Optimization at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). I work with [Francisco C. Pereira](http://camara.scripts.mit.edu/home/), [Dario Pacino](https://www.dtu.dk/english/service/phonebook/person?id=53748&tab=2&qt=dtupublicationquery) and [Filipe Rodrigues](http://fprodrigues.com/) on applying pattern recognition, machine learning and optimization to understand and predict mobility behaviour within the [Machine Learning for Smart Mobility](http://mlsm.man.dtu.dk/) group. 

With my research, I am interested in addressing the following question: how can we build artificial agents capable of effective decision-making under uncertainty by abstracting meaningful representations from raw sensory data? In particular, I focus on machine learning for probabilistic inference, deep reinforcement learning, and deep generative models. As part of my PhD, I am interested in applying these concepts for future smart mobility solutions.

Before joining DTU, I graduated from the University of Rome "La Sapienza" with a MSc in Quantitative Methods for Decision Making within the Management Engineering Degree. Back in Rome I worked on my [MSc thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T6a5dVXDqlzcvUWyrNrvMzBW19Q7RvUW/view?usp=sharing) by applying machine learning and probabilistic models to health applications (in particular we worked on "Multiple Sclerosis course prediction").

I also worked in the Operations Research Team of Amazon EU within [Amazon Transportation Services](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/business_categories/transport) where we applied Optimization and Machine Learning models for the planning of EU's truck schedules.

I am excited about improving science towards a more human-level AI through machine learning. Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:daga@dtu.dk) for any intersting discussion ;-)
