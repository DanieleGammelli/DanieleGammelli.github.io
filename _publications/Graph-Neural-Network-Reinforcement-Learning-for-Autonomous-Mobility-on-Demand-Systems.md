excerpt: 'In this work, we propose the use of graph neural networks to centrally control AMoD systems. We argue that graph neural networks exhibit a number of desirable properties, and propose an actor-critic formulation as a general approach to learn proactive, scalable, and transferable rebalancing policies.'

**Abstract:** Autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems represent a rapidly developing mode of transportationwherein travel requests are dynamically handled by a coordinated fleet of robotic, self-driving vehicles. Given a graph
representation of the transportation network - one where, for
example, nodes represent areas of the city, and edges the
connectivity between them - we argue that the AMoD control
problem is naturally cast as a node-wise decision-making problem. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning
framework to control the rebalancing of AMoD systems through
graph neural networks. Crucially, we demonstrate that graph
neural networks enable reinforcement learning agents to recover behavior policies that are significantly more transferable,
generalizable, and scalable than policies learned through other
approaches. Empirically, we show how the learned policies
exhibit promising zero-shot transfer capabilities when faced
with critical portability tasks such as inter-city generalization,
service area expansion, and adaptation to potentially complex
urban topologies.
